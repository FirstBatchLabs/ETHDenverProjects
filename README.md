# ETH Denver Projects
List of projects attending ETH Denver 2023. 
> This is an early iteration of the list with just a spreadsheet to get things started, a clean frontend and a user-friendly contribution mechanism will be implemented next week.

## Inclusion Criteria 
For the first iteration of the list only the sponsors were included, but any project attending to ETH Denver can add their project info to the list.

## How to Contribute
Next week, there will be a simple interface to provide project info. For now you can directly edit the [ETH Denver Projects.csv](https://github.com/FirstBatchLabs/ETHDenverProjects/blob/main/ETH%20Denver%20Projects.csv) file and create a pull request like this:
